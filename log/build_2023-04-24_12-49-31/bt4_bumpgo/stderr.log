[33mCMake Warning at CMakeLists.txt:16 (find_package):
  By not providing "FindZMQ.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "ZMQ", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "ZMQ" with any of
  the following names:

    ZMQConfig.cmake
    zmq-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "ZMQ" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set "ZMQ_DIR"
  to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "ZMQ" provides a
  separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been installed.
